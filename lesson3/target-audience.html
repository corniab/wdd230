        <h2>Personas</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Persona 1: </b>Dallin owns a small construction business in
            Riverton, Utah. His wife and 4 kids always look forward to their
            monthly boating trips to Bear Lake in the summer months. They love
            to explore and to find fun places to eat nearby. Dallin typically
            checks the weather forecast on his phone to decide if they should
            make the trip. His kids love to be in the water and his wife loves
            to spend time relaxing with the family. Dallin enjoys using the site
            because it gives him all the information he needs to plan his trips
            on one page.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Persona 2: </b>McKenna has been fly fishing since she could pick
            up a rod. She is a Biology major at Utah State in Logan, Utah. Born
            and raised in Pocatello, she frequently makes weekend trips to Idaho
            to go fishing and visit her family. Her student apartment doesn't
            have much room for her to tie flies so she often picks up new flies
            at local bait shops. She scans the website to learn about fishing
            conditions and to study maps for new fishing spots.
          </li>
